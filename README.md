# Design of a classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify digits
The mini-project aims to design a classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify digits.

## Convolutional Neural Networks
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are a type of artificial neural network that excel in image processing and recognition tasks. They are specifically designed to effectively analyze and classify images by learning hierarchical patterns and features directly from the data.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specialized type of artificial neural network designed to process and analyze visual data, particularly images. They have revolutionized the field of computer vision and are widely used in various applications such as image classification, object detection, facial recognition, and more. 

What sets CNNs apart is their ability to automatically learn and extract meaningful features directly from raw image data. They achieve this through a series of interconnected layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. 

Convolutional layers apply filters to the input image, convolving them across the entire image to extract local patterns and features. These filters detect edges, textures, and other important characteristics that are crucial for image understanding. Pooling layers downsample the feature maps, reducing their spatial dimensions while preserving important information. This helps in reducing computational complexity and improving robustness to variations in the input.

CNNs also utilize the concept of parameter sharing, which allows the network to learn and recognize patterns regardless of their location in the image. This property, known as translation invariance, makes CNNs well-suited for tasks like digit recognition, where the position of the digit may vary within the image.

Through a process called backpropagation, CNNs iteratively adjust their internal weights and biases to minimize the difference between predicted and actual outputs. This training process allows them to learn complex representations and achieve high levels of accuracy in visual recognition tasks.

CNNs have demonstrated remarkable performance in a wide range of applications, achieving state-of-the-art results in image classification challenges such as ImageNet. They have also paved the way for advancements in fields like self-driving cars, medical imaging, and augmented reality. With their ability to automatically learn and extract features, CNNs have become an indispensable tool for visual data analysis and continue to drive innovation in the field of computer vision.

## Project Implementation
In this project, the goal is to design a classifier using CNN to identify digits. The project involves the following steps:

1. Accessing Data: The project starts by accessing the dataset containing images of digits. The dataset is then divided into training and testing sets.

2. Creating and Configuring Network Layers: The CNN architecture is constructed by defining and configuring various layers such as imageInputLayer, convolutional layers, batch normalization layers, ReLU layers, max pooling layers, fully connected layers, softmax layer, and classification layer. These layers are organized in a sequential manner to extract relevant features from the input images.

3. Training Network: The CNN is trained using the training data. The training process involves adjusting the weights and biases of the network based on the input images and their corresponding labels. This process is typically done using optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam optimizer. During training, the network learns to recognize patterns and features that are discriminative for digit classification.

4. Checking Network Accuracy: The accuracy of the trained network is evaluated using the testing data. The performance of the CNN is measured by comparing the predicted labels with the ground truth labels of the testing set. Adjustments to the network configuration and training parameters can be made to improve the accuracy of the model.

Overall, this project leverages CNN's ability to learn and extract meaningful features from images to develop a classifier capable of accurately identifying digits. By training the CNN on a dataset of labeled digit images, the network learns to recognize and classify digits based on the extracted features, paving the way for various applications such as digit recognition systems and optical character recognition (OCR) tasks.
